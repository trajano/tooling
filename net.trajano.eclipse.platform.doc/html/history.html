<h1>Release History</h1>

<table summary="">
	<tr>
		<td>4.0.0</td>
		<td>
		<ul>
			<li>Build process has been converted to Tycho.</li>
		</ul>
		</td>
	</tr>
	<!-- <tr>
		<td>3.3.0.2</td>
		<td>
		<ul>
			<li>Converted the openers to an extension point?  or a preference screen that does X?  Extension point makes things cleaner, the preference screen allows for end users to just add new ones without having as an extension point.</li>
			<li>With an Extension point I can provide icons, Mnemonics, etc.</li>
			<li>I think I would combine the two create a dynamic section that allows the user to add additional openers as needed and convert the existing two as extension points.</li>
			<li>The copy to clipboard has be refactored out to its own plugin</li>
			<li>Separated the JDT specific code from the rest of the code and put it in its own plugin and feature.</li>

		</ul>
		</td>
	</tr> -->
	<tr>
		<td>3.6.1.1</td>
		<td>
		<ul>
			<li>Corrected the logic for the fully qualified path.  It was
			not as simple as changing the separator character if I needed support for non-Java files.</li>
			<li>Added contribution to list adapters for a selected object
			and copy it to the clipboard.</li>
		</ul>
		</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>3.6.1.0</td>
		<td>
		<ul>
			<li>Added capability of copying the fully qualified path. Useful
			for those instances when you use Class.getResource or Spring.</li>
			<li>Added contributions to the welcome overview and what's new
			pages</li>
		</ul>
		</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>3.5.0.1</td>
		<td>
		<ul>
			<li>Separated the selection processor plug-in into two plugins.
			Known overkill, but it will allow creating a feature that does not
			require JDT for those that may need it.</li>
			<li>Fixed a bug on the OpenFolder plug-in for the Mac where it
			does not open the folder in command prompt when a file is selected.</li>
			<li>Changed the icons and text for Open Folder to be Mac
			specific.</li>
			<li>Added a new plug-in for Eclipse Platform property testing.</li>
		</ul>
		</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>3.5.0.0</td>
		<td>
		<ul>
			<li>Target Eclipse 3.5 and above, but since I didn't really
			write any code specific to Eclipse 3.5 I am putting the version to be
			at least 3.0 and above if anyone is having trouble please file a bug
			report so I can determine the minimum version.</li>
			<li>I am still keeping JRE 1.4 as the minimum requirement rather
			than taking advantage of the JRE 5.0 features for now.</li>
			<li>I also took out the locale requirements since not everyone
			is "en" and I didn't realize it was going to cause issues.</li>
			<li>Added defaults for MacOSX.</li>
			<li>For MacOSX, "Open in Command Prompt" is not configurable, it
			works by executing an AppleScript that is hard coded into the
			plug-in.</li>
		</ul>
		</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>3.3.0.1</td>
		<td>
		<ul>
			<li>Got rid of "Open Folder -&lt; In Navigator" since the
			functionality is already available in Eclipse (somewhat) it is called
			"Show In...". Theoretically it might be better to put the Open Folder
			functionality in the same sub-menu, but Eclipse didn't expose their
			APIs to allow us to do it without touching the internals.</li>
			<li>Migrated from <tt>org.eclipse.ui.popupMenus</tt> and switch
			to <tt>org.eclipse.ui.commands</tt> and <tt>org.eclipse.ui.menus</tt>.
			This switch will eventually enable me to use dynamic menus so users
			can add an arbitrary amount of Open Folder commands in the future.
			This is the reason why I didn't get rid of the Actions as of yet
			since I would be working them into actions later. This was also done
			as well for Copy to Clipboard.</li>
			<li>The changes made the "Open Folder" also prevent "Open
			Folder" from being displayed if the object does not support it.</li>
			<li>Changed the documentation to use the MANIFEST.MF approach</li>
			<li>Added a separate field for the case when a file has been
			selected and Open In Explorer had been selected.</li>
		</ul>
		</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>3.3.0.0</td>
		<td>
		<ul>
			<li>Migrated to use Eclipse 3.3 APIs. This is not compatible
			with 3.2 and below.</li>
			<li>This is targeting JDK 1.4 so there are no use of advanced
			JDK 5.0 features such as generics in order to preserve compatibility
			with users still using 1.4 JDK as their VM.</li>
			<li><a href="http://maven.apache.org/">Maven</a> use was removed
			since the PDE removes the <i>.classpath</i> entries put in by Maven.
			However, the Maven style paths have been kept.</li>
			<li>Some i18n work has been done. It is primarily used for
			establishing the environment, so the translations are going to need a
			lot of work. The translations are separated into fragments ending in
			<tt>.i18n</tt>.</li>
			<li>The preference page for the recycle workspace and garbage
			collection has been separated into two individual pages. Since
			Eclipse has support for "searching" the preference pages, it would
			make more sense that they only contain what the user would ask for.
			However, each preference page description has keyword references to
			"Eclipse Platform Extensions" and "Platform Extensions" so the user
			can easily search for it using the old name.</li>
		</ul>
		</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>3.2.0.4</td>
		<td>
		<ul>
			<li>Added back the "Startup" class in order for the autobuild to
			put in the proper state.</li>
			<li>Combined the Autobuild with the Garbage collection.</li>
		</ul>
		</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>3.2.0.3</td>
		<td>
		<ul>
			<li>Added back Autobuild toolbar button. It just reuses the
			Build Automatically action already present in the Project menu.</li>
		</ul>
		</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>3.2.0.2</td>
		<td>
		<ul>
			<li>Fixed a missed &lt;tr&gt; in the release history page.</li>
			<li>Updated help to reflect new location of Restart and GC.</li>
			<li>Removed all deprecated code warnings.</li>
			<li>Ran code through <a href="http://checkstyle.sf.net">CheckStyle</a>
			(with customized settings).</li>
			<li>Changed license to Academic Free License</li>
			<li>Updated Trove categorizations in the <a
				href="http://sf.net/projects/ttl">SourceForge project</a>, but the
			UNIX name is still kept.</li>
			<li>Made a mistake in the JRE used to compile. It now uses the
			IBM J2SE 1.4 SDK so it will work properly with Rational Application
			Developer 6.0</li>
			<li>Tested with Eclipse 3.2M5 as well.</li>
		</ul>
		</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>3.2.0.1</td>
		<td>
		<ul>
			<li>Applied <a
				href="https://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=1231468&group_id=19081&atid=319081">patch
			1231468</a>.</li>
			<li>Fixed problem with copying fully qualified name on objects
			that have no package.</li>
			<li>Added support for multiple selection on copying file name
			and fully qualified name to clipboard. <a
				href="http://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=1251055&group_id=19081&atid=369081">Feature
			Request 1251055</a>.</li>
			<li>Removed Platform menu and moved the Restart and GC to the
			file menu.</li>
		</ul>
		</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>3.2.0.0</td>
		<td>
		<ul>
			<li>Tested and developed on Eclipse 3.2M4. However, there is no
			use of 3.2 specific APIs.</li>
			<li>Split up the "Open Folder in..." functionality to its own
			plugin and is a total rewrite.</li>
			<li>The marker is now <tt>{}</tt> rather than <tt>{0}</tt>.</li>
			<li>The "Open Folder in..." plugin also defines an extension
			point for supporting other selection processors so people can create
			their own processor as needed without waiting for me to develop it.
			To facilitate this, the popup will accept any IAdaptable. However,
			there isn't any documentation to allow explicit activation of an
			IObjectActionDelegate so if the user tries to open the folder of an
			unsupported object, it will display a the following message: "The
			chosen operation is not enabled" the first time it is activated and
			the object type is not supported.</li>
			<li>The open in navigator function is a bit smarter in that it
			will only be present for IResource objects.</li>
			<li>A "Test" button is provided so the user can test if it the
			application name they entered is correct.</li>
			<li>There is support for OS dependent command line strings.
			However, only Windows has been put in until suitable values for other
			OSes can be determined.</li>
		</ul>

	</tr>

	<tr>
		<td>3.1.0.2</td>
		<td>
		<ul>
			<li>Added System.runFinalizer() on garbage collection.</li>
			<li>Added CVS <a
				href="http://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=1116818&group_id=19081&atid=319081">patch</a>.</li>
		</ul>
		</td>

	<tr>
		<td>3.1.0.1</td>
		<td>
		<ul>
			<li>Fixed to work with the 3.1 M4 and above.</li>
		</ul>
		</td>
	</tr>

	<tr>
		<td>1.2.4</td>
		<td>
		<ul>
			<li>Removed build automatically function since Eclipse 3.0
			already provides the functionality.</li>

			<li>Added copy fully qualified name on java elements.</li>

			<li>This version will only work on Eclipse 3.0.</li>
		</ul>
		</td>
	</tr>

	<tr>
		<td>1.2.1</td>
		<td>
		<ul>
			<li>Split the property pages for Garbage collection and Open
			folder into their own sub-pages in Workbench</li>

			<li>Fixed the formatting and icons on some of the help files.</li>

			<li>Ran plugin migration utilities to migrate to Eclipse 3.0.</li>

			<li>Fixed autobuild so that it would work with the 3.0 API from
			M5.</li>

			<li>Removed support for 2.1 as the API changes in 3.0 M5 are too
			big to allow for a hybrid 2.1 + 3.0 support. This was caused by the
			move to the Rich Client Platform which changed some of the package
			names around. On the bright note, the older version will still work
			with 2.1.</li>
		</ul>
		</td>
	</tr>

	<tr>
		<td>1.2.0</td>
		<td>
		<ul>
			<li>Allow background garbage collection (only on Eclipse SDK 3.0
			M4)</li>

			<li>Open folder in Explorer and Command Prompt are run as a
			background task (only on Eclipse SDK 3.0 and above)</li>

			<li>Restart Workbench defaults to "No"</li>

			<li>Added "Copy Name To Clipboard" which copies the OS path name
			of the selected resource to the clipboard</li>

			<li>Added "Open Folder" -&gt; "In Navigator" which opens the
			containing folder in the Navigator view.</li>

			<li>Added instructions on how to activate the extension on
			Eclipse 2.1 and WebSphere Application Developer&nbsp;5.1</li>
		</ul>

		<p class="fineprint">There were two interim releases before 1.2.0:
		1.1.1 and 1.1.2, but they were removed because of a bug that prevented
		it from working in Eclipse 2.1 and WSAD 5.1 which I couldn't fix
		without a lot of work so I removed them from the SourceForge site.
		This release has been fixed to work on Eclipse 2.1 though.</p>
