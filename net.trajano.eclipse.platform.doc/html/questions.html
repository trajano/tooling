<h1>Questions to fellow Eclipse plug-in developers</h1>
<div class="content">
<p>I am not sure about you, but I find going through the newsgroups
for Eclipse development support is annoying at best, waste of time at
worst. So I am posting my questions about Eclipse development here I
hope you can provide me some answers.</p>
<ul>
	<li>Is there a way to get <a href="http://maven.apache.org/">Maven</a>to
	build the plug-ins for me?</li>
	<li>How do you get a welcome page working in a plugin? I tried
	putting in a welcome.xml file but it does not seem to use it.</li>
	<li>How do I put an icon in the parent menu item for a popup
	action? In my case the "Open Folder" menu item, I want it to have a
	folder icon beside it, but I can't seem to get it there.</li>
	<li>How can I put "Open Folder" in the same group as "Open" and
	"Open with..."?</li>
	<li>How do I add help in the Preferences dialog</li>
	<li>How do I detect that the progress dialog is opened or closed?
	I want to do something like if the progress dialog was open for more
	than X seconds, beep.</li>
	<li>How do I pretty print XML? Everything I do seems to get left
	flushed.</li>
	<li>How can you add a pop-up menu to an existing editor? I tried
	to set the targetID in the viewerExtension tag as
	org.eclipse.ui.editors.text.TextEditor but no luck.</li>
</ul>

<p>Also here are some other ideas for plug-ins:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Library builder like the one in PDE but for the WEB-INF/lib
	directory, or a lib directory in a project.</li>
	<li>RMI remote control application to remotely control Eclipse.
	Primarily I want to use it to tell Eclipse refresh the files after
	generating code in a batch file.</li>
</ul>
