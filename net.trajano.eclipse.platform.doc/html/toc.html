<p>This plug-in adds the following extensions to the Eclipse
environment:</p>

<table summary="">
<tr>
<td><img src="../icons/clipboard.gif" alt="icon"> </td>
<td>Copy&nbsp;Name&nbsp;To&nbsp;Clipboard &gt; File Name</td>
<td>
<p>This copies the file name of the resource to the clipboard. It
copies the OS path using
<code>resource.getLocation().toOSString()</code> to the clipboard
using <code>new&nbsp; Clipboard(...).setContents(...)</code>. To
get the current display use <code>Display.getCurrent()</code> .</p>
</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><img src="../icons/clipboard.gif" alt="icon"> </td>
<td>Copy&nbsp;Name&nbsp;To&nbsp;Clipboard &gt; Fully Qualified
Name</td>
<td>
<p>This copies the fully qualified name of a Java element. If a
package is selected it will give the fully qualified name of the
package.  This will only work on Java Classes and packages.</p>
</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><img src="../icons/cmd.png" alt="icon"> </td>
<td>Open Folder &gt; In&nbsp;Command Prompt</td>
<td>
<p>This opens the containing folder of the resource or the folder
itself in the command prompt window.</p>
</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><img src="../icons/explorer.png" alt="icon"> </td>
<td>Open Folder &gt; In&nbsp;Explorer</td>
<td>
<p>This opens the containing folder of the resource or the folder
itself in Windows explorer.</p>

<p>This is similar to the functionality of EasyExplore, but allows
multiple selections to be opened and logic to prevent it from
opening those it cannot open.</p>
</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><img src="../icons/filenav_nav.gif" alt="icon"> </td>
<td>Open Folder &gt; In&nbsp;Navigator</td>
<td>
<p>This opens the containing folder of the resource or the folder
itself in the navigator view. It will open up the view in the
current perspective if needed.</p>
</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><img src="../icons/recycle.gif" alt="icon"> </td>
<td>Restart Workbench<br>
(in the File menu)</td>
<td>
<p>Restarts the workbench. This is useful if you play around with
plugins a lot which require Eclipse to restart. That way you don't
have to wait for Eclipse to fully exit before you restart. This
would free up more memory than just performing a garbage collection
call as all the loaded plugins are freed up from memory again.</p>

<p>For plug-in developers, you can use this plug-in to restart your
runtime workbench and it will force your plug-ins to be reloaded as
well.</p>

<p>This is not available in the toolbar to prevent accidental
restarts.</p>

<p>The action calls the <code>restart()</code> method in the
current workbench.</p>
</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><img src="../icons/garbage.gif" alt="icon"> </td>
<td>Run Garbage Collection<br>
(in the File menu)</td>
<td>
<p>This executes <code>System.gc()</code> which forces the JVM
garbage collector to start. Please note if there is a large memory
chunk to be freed, it may crash Eclipse which is why the action
asks you to save your open editors before performing it (this
setting is configurable).</p>

<p>The plug-in takes advantage of the 3.0 SDK's new background job
API for garbage collection. However, it will still work with the
2.1 SDK as it automatically detects if you are using the 3.0 SDK or
higher, so you will not have troubles running it on previous
versions of Eclipse or WebSphere Application Developer 5.1.</p>
