<h1>Personal blurb</h1>
<div class="content">
<p>The primary purpose of making this plug-in is to be a <b>fun</b>
little exercise for me to learn Eclipse plug-in development. So I may
stop development when I don't find it fun anymore.</p>
<p>What then? Well the project is available as a <a
	href="http://sf.net/projects/ttl">SourceForge project</a>, so anyone
who wants to take it over from me is welcome to do so, just ask.</p>
<p>This plug-in is meant to fix some annoying things I find that in my
favourite IDE for everything. I b**ched enough about it. so I might as
well do something about it (and learn from it too).</p>
